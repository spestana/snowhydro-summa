    "Now that you know how to run SUMMA and have changed model options and parameters, the introduction for the second homework is much shorter. In this second homework, the focus will be on changing the meteorological variables that form the time-varying boundary conditions for the model simulations. They are also commonly referred to as model forcings. You will also modify some options that change how these model forcings are changed near the surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "SUMMA forcing files are in NetCDF format and described in the [SUMMA documentation](https://summa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input_output/SUMMA_input/#meteorological-forcing-files). We will provide you with some functions and python code to modify the input files for the various exercises.\n",

    "* `homework_2_B_setup.ipynb` : get setup to do the exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "* `homework_2_C_exercise_1.ipynb` : instructions for homework 2, exercise 1 -- modify the wind speed\n",

    "Just as in Homework 1, remember that you want to save your notebooks in a place other than the `examples` directory tree, because files you save there may be deleted and overwritten the next time you start your virtual machine. Save your files somewhere in the `work` directory tree: `work/homework_2` would be a great place for them. So click on \"_File --> Save Notebook As..._\" and save this notebook as `work/homework_2/homework_2_A_introduction.ipynb` before you continue. If things go hopelessly wrong, you can always start over again with the original notebook in your `examples` directory tree."

    "You'll be using most of the techniques you learned in Homework 1 to modify SUMMA input files and to interact with HydroShare. These are not explained any more. You can look back at the Homework 1 notebooks to see how to do this. The new part here is that you will be modifying the NetCDF model forcing files. We don't need any special pySUMMA functions to accomplish this. Instead, we will use some of the functionality that is part of the [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) package, which is a very powerful package for analyzing and manipulating NetCDF files. `xarray` is already installed in this virtual machine, so there is no additional setup to get access to this package.\n",
