Then save the file somewhere in your `work` directory. Files that you save in your `work` directory tree will persist between successive logins (i.e. they will still be there when you come back later), but files in the `examples` directory will be overwritten as we make the new homework assignments available."

    "You can find the instructions for the software carpentry python tutorial at: http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation. You can skip the setup step in that tutorial as we have taken care of that for you with this virtual machine and by pre-installing the necessary files. So start with the _Analyzing Patient Data_ step. In the second half of that page you will start loading data into python. Just remember that the files are already pre-installed. You just need to prepend the filenames with `/home/jovyan/examples/swc/data`, so `inflammation-01.csv` becomes `/home/jovyan/examples/swc/data/inflammation-01.csv`."
