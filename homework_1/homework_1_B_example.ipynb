If you are not familiar with this format, then it would be a good idea for your research career to learn how to read them. A lot of analysis software will be able to read NetCDF files directly or through the use of some add-ons (this includes python, R, matlab, etc.). Some of the nice features of NetCDF files are that the metadata is part of the files themselves, the files are machine-independent, and they are great for storing multi-dimensional data. For example, the SUMMA NetCDF files include the settings for the model decisions as part of the metadata."

However, this course is not long enough to teach you how to do all this and you can learn much of this on your own. If you are not able to read NetCDF files, the easiest way to proceed is to export some of the data as csv files (_comma-separated values_), which can be read by almost any analysis software. You can do that on your local machine, but here we'll show you how to export some of your data to csv and add it to your existing HydroShare resource. "
